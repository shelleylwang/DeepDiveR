# Introduction

`DeepDiveR` is an R package for estimating biodiversity through time from fossil occurrence data. It produces formatted input data and a configuration file that can then be executed in Python through the command line, enabling a clear and reproducible workflow. In this tutorial we will use DeepDiveR to analyse the past diversity of Carnivora, an order of mammals, using the data of Faurby et al. (2024).

# Installation

To install the `DeepDiveR` library, it needs to be downloaded from the GitHub repository using either the package `remotes` or a manual download.

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# Option 1: install the package from GitHub
remotes::install_github("DeepDive-project/DeepDiveR")
# Option 2: load it from a directory after downloading it from
# https://github.com/DeepDive-project/DeepDiveR
# deepdiver_path <- "path_to_DeepDiveR"
# setwd(deepdiver_path)
# library(devtools)
# load_all(".")
```

We can then load the `DeepDiveR` package.

```{r load_packages}
library(DeepDiveR)
```

# Preparing the input data

First we will load our carnivoran occurrence data. This is included within the `DeepDiveR` package.

```{r load_data}
# Load Carnivora.Rdata
data(carnivora)
```

Next, we will view the first few rows of the `data.frame` to get a sense of its contents.

```{r view_data}
# View first six rows
head(carnivora)
```

We can see that our `data.frame` has 5 columns, describing the taxon name, the geographic area where it occurs, the minimum and maximum age range, and a locality identifier. Each row in the `data.frame` corresponds to a single occurrence. This is the standard format of data needed by `DeepDiveR`, so we do not need to manipulate the data here.

However, we do need to specify the time bins into which our occurrences will be placed. They do not need to be equally spaced, geological intervals can be used if desired. Here we will use divisions based on the stages of the Cenozoic, averaged to approximately one million year duration. We will do this by describing a vector which provides the bin boundaries, in millions of years.

```{r set_time}
# Describe vector of bin boundaries
bins <- c(max(carnivora$MaxAge), 65, 64, 63, 61.6, 60, 59.2, 58.13333, 57.06667, 56, 54.975, 53.95, 52.925, 51.9, 50.875, 49.85, 48.825, 47.8, 46.85714, 45.91429, 44.97143, 44.02857, 43.08571, 42.14286, 41.2, 40.03667, 38.87333, 37.71, 36.7575, 35.805, 34.8525, 33.9, 32.88667, 31.87333, 30.86, 29.84667, 28.83333, 27.82, 26.862, 25.904, 24.946, 23.988, 23.03, 22.16667, 21.30333, 20.44, 19.3225, 18.205, 17.0875, 15.97, 14.895, 13.82, 12.725, 11.63, 10.534, 9.438, 8.342, 7.246, 6.2895, 5.333, 4.4665, 3.6, 2.58, 1.8, 0.774, 0.129, 0)
```

Now we can prepare the input file for `DeepDive`, using the function `prep_dd_input`. Here we need to specify the `data.frame` containing the occurrence data and vector of time bins. We also want to provide the number of replicates, i.e. how many times we want the occurrences to be placed into the time bins. Here we will specify 10 replicates, to illustrate the process, but a higher number of replicates is needed to capture temporal uncertainty in final analyses e.g. 100. Finally, we also need to give the name of the file that we want to be created. The file takes the form `.csv`, indicating that the values are comma-separated. This will be the file we need to input into `DeepDive`.

```{r create_data, eval = FALSE}
# Create input file for DeepDive
prep_dd_input(
  # Specify occurrence data.frame
  dat = carnivora,
  # Specify vector containing time bin boundaries
  bins = bins,
  # Specify number of replicates
  r = 10, 
  # Specify name of created file
  output_file = "carnivora_deepdive_input.csv" 
)
```

# Preparing the configuration file

Now we need to create a configuration file for `DeepDive`, using the function `create_config`. Here we will describe all of the internal settings for the analysis. Some of the settings must be described by the user. These include...

```{r create_config}
# Create configuration file for DeepDive
config <- create_config(
  # Specify the name for the simulations
  name = "carnivora",
  # Specify the name of the data file
  data_file = "carnivora_deepdive_input.csv",
  # Specify vector containing time bin boundaries
  bins = bins,
  # Specify the number of geographic areas to simulate
  n_areas = length(unique(carnivora$Area))
)
```

Other settings are autofilled by `create_config()`. In order to alter these, we can use the function `edit_config()`. First, we know that there are 313 extant carnivorans, so let's condition our simulations on this number of living species.

```{r modify_config}
# Modify the number of extant species ("present_diversity") in simulations
edit_config(config = config,
            module = "general",
            parameter = "present_diversity", 
            value = 313)
```

It is possible to allow the geographic areas available in the simulations to change through time. In order to do this, we will create an `areas_matrix` object which will be incorporated in the configuration file. Here, we will assume that dispersal of carnivorans to South America was started between 11 and 7 Ma. Regions disappearing instead of connecting can be made by setting the label argument to: presence = "FALSE".

```{r geog_limits}
# Create data.frame describing the time for which each area is available
area_ages <- rbind(c("Africa", max(bins), max(bins)), 
                   c("Asia", max(bins), max(bins)),
                   c("Europe", max(bins), max(bins)),
                   c("North America", max(bins), max(bins)),
                   c("South America", 11.608, 7.3))
area_ages <- as.data.frame(area_ages)

# Label columns
colnames(area_ages) <- c("Area", "MaxAge", "MinAge")

# Connect area data to configuration file
areas_matrix(config = config, area_ages = area_ages)
```

Now we need to describe the technical aspects of the neural network training and analysis process. For a reliable estimate, you will need at least 10,000 training simulations. However, for the purpose of running a quick test analysis, we will use a low number of both training and test simulations. Again we will edit the relevant parameters in the configuration file using the `edit_config` function:

```{r describe_setup}
# Set number of training simulations to 100
edit_config(config = config,
            module = "simulations",
            parameter = "n_training_simulations", 
            value = 100)

# Set number of test simulations to 10
edit_config(config = config,
            module = "simulations",
            parameter = "n_test_simulations", 
            value = 10)
```

Now we are ready to write the configuration file to use in the analysis:

```{r write_config, eval = FALSE}
# Write the configuration file
config$write("carnivora_config.ini")
```

# Executing the analysis

Once the configuration and input files are created, the full DeepDive analysis including simulation, model training and predictions can be carried out through a single command line entered in a Terminal (MacOS and Linux) or Command prompt (Windows) window executing the Python script run_dd_config.py as follows:

```{python run, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
python run_dd_config.py your_path/config_file.ini
```

You can additionally specify a working directory where all output files are saved and the number of CPUs used in parallelised simulations, which will overwrite the corresponding settings in the configuration file, using the flags -wd and -cpu, e.g.

```{python run2, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
python run_dd_config.py your_path/config_file.ini -wd your_working_directory -cpu 64
```

This script will create a "simulations" folder containing the training and test sets and a "trained_models" folder containing the trained models and plots of training history. This folder additionally includes plots of features of the empirical and simulated records (e.g. number of occurrences through time and per area, number of localities, fraction of singletons and sampled diversity), CSV files with the predicted diversity trajectories for the test set and for the empirical dataset, and a plot of the estimated diversity trajectory.
